# Todo list of React Module Project.

### Updated to commit #33 | Date 26/04/2025:

## Changes:

- Finished the login page except the validation.
- Modified the `FormInput` a bit so the wrapping `div` of the `input` and the `label` will not be bigger then the `input` element itself.
- Made the `h2` element title be as large as possible but still in one line and not obstructed / overflowing of it's parent `div` element.

## Todo:

- [ ] Implement the login functionality.
  - [ ] Create and apply the validations of the login.
- [ ] Implement the register functionality.

## Done:

- [x] Setting up the project structure.

  > #### The NavBar has the following components:

- [x] Create a NavBar component.

  - [x] Logo Section.
  - [x] SearchBox component.
  - DarkModeToggle component which is already implemented in react. -> Created a wrapper component for customizing the component.

- [x] Create a card component.

- [x] To add cards container.
- [x] To get cards from the api.

- [x] Need to fix the problem when changing into a page in the pagination where the cards have a longer text and it seems like a jump because of the height resizing...

- Created a `FormButton` component.
- Added tailwind css classes suggestions to any variable, prop or constant ending with the suffix `ClassName` or `ClassList`.
