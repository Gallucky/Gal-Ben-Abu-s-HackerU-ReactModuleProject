Github Co-Pilot prompt to update the changelog file:

You are managing documentation updates in a Git repository with a focus on accurate change tracking.  
Use the output of running at the background:
- `git status` to detect file-level changes (added, modified, deleted, renamed).
- `git diff` to understand line-level edits and completed TODOs.

### TASK:

Generate Markdown content updates for two files: `Changelog.md` and `todo-list.md`, based only on the uncommitted changes in the current working directory.

---

1. Update `Changelog.md`

Replace the current top entry with the following format:

## 📅 Updated to Commit #<Next Commit Number> | Date: *<Current Date>*

### 🔗 [Open TODO List](./todo-list.md)

### ✅ Completed
- List completed TODO items, mark each with:
  - ✅ Summary of the task.
  - 🔗 [file at line](./path/to/file)

### ➕ Added
- List newly created files or major components.
- Format: 🔗 [filename](./path/to/file)

### 🔄 Changed
- List modified files.
- Brief summary from diff.
- Link to relevant file section.

### 🗑️ Deleted
- List deleted files.

### 🏷️ Renamed / Moved
- Show: `old/path.ts → new/path.ts`
- With links: [old](./old/path.ts) → [new](./new/path.ts)

---

2. Update `todo-list.md`

Format should be:

# 📘 <Project Name> - Todo List

[`← Back Changelog`](./Changelog.md)

- [x] Completed task summary [`#<Next Commit Number>`](./commits_changes/commit_<same_number>.md)
- [ ] New or remaining task

For completed tasks:
- Mark with [x]
- Add markdown link with next commit number

Do NOT reflect already committed history. Only include current uncommitted changes.

---

3. Formatting Rules

- Use clean, valid Markdown.
- Ensure `Changelog.md` and `todo-list.md` are consistent and synchronized.
- All links must follow markdown syntax and must be in the form:
  [`#<commit number>`](./commits_changes/commit_<commit number>.md)

---

4. Constraints

- ❌ Never use or show raw Git commands.
- ✅ Result must be persistent and reflect the current uncommitted state every time it's applied.
- 📌 Even if linked files (e.g., `./commits_changes/commit_60.md`) don't exist yet, include them as markdown links with commit number.
