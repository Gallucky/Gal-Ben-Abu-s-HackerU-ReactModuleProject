Github Co-Pilot prompt to update the changelog file:

You are managing documentation updates in a Git repository with a focus on accurate change tracking.  
Use the output of running at the background:
- `git status` to detect file-level changes (added, modified, deleted, renamed).
- `git diff` to understand line-level edits and completed TODOs.

### TASK:

Generate Markdown content updates for two files: `Changelog.md` and `todo-list.md`, based only on the uncommitted changes in the current working directory.

---

1. Update `Changelog.md`

Replace the current top entry with the following format:

## 📅 Updated to Commit #<Next Commit Number> | Date: *<Current Date>*

### 🔗 [Open TODO List](./todo-list.md)

### ✅ Completed
- List completed TODO items, mark each with:
  - ✅ Summary of the task.
  - 🔗 [file at line](./path/to/file)

### ➕ Added
- List newly created files or major components.
- Format: 🔗 [filename](./path/to/file)

### 🔄 Changed
- List modified files.
- Brief summary from diff.
- Link to relevant file section.

### 🗑️ Deleted
- List deleted files.

### 🏷️ Renamed / Moved
- Show: `old/path.ts → new/path.ts`
- With links: [old](./old/path.ts) → [new](./new/path.ts)

---

2. Update `todo-list.md`

Format should be:

# 📘 <Project Name> - Todo List

[`← Back Changelog`](./Changelog.md)

- [x] Completed task summary [`#<Next Commit Number>`](./commits_changes/commit_<same_number>.md)
- [ ] New or remaining task

For completed tasks:
- Mark with [x]
- Add markdown link with next commit number

Do NOT reflect already committed history. Only include current uncommitted changes.

---

3. Formatting Rules

- Use clean, valid Markdown.
- Ensure `Changelog.md` and `todo-list.md` are consistent and synchronized.
- All links must follow markdown syntax and must be in the form:
  [`#<commit number>`](./commits_changes/commit_<commit number>.md)

---

4. Constraints

- ❌ Never use or show raw Git commands.
- ✅ Result must be persistent and reflect the current uncommitted state every time it's applied.
- 📌 Even if linked files (e.g., `./commits_changes/commit_60.md`) don't exist yet, include them as markdown links with commit number.

---

### 🔗 [Open TODO List](./todo-list.md)

### ✅ Completed

### 🗑️ Deleted

> `Nothing has been deleted.`

`todo-list.md`:
## 📋 Todo

- [ ] example task 1
- [ ] example task 2
- [ ] example task 3
- [ ] etc...

## ✅ Completed

| `Task`                                                                                         | `Link/s`                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `Commit #`                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| task description | link/links | commit_number_link |

Can you base the response from the output of:
git status:


git diff:


And can you please link to the each part, if is a page then do [`Page name Page`](relative path) the name of the link with backticks.
incase of a component same as page - name of the component following 'Component' keywords.
otherwise only the name of the file in backticks as the relative link's text content.

in the `todo-list.md`:
Show me what to add along with related link/links like previously mentioned and from what commit it was completed if it is the uncommitted changes commit then still do the following commit link [`#commit number`](relative-path-to-commit_commit-number.md...
The completed todo parts/lines should be in the `markdown` table format of | message | link/links | link to commit_commit-number.md file |
